First wait for 2 seconds to load, once done, you should be able to be waiting for an input like this:

Here you input the first filename, dont inlcude `.db`, and i dont recommend creating or loading a blank database!

**For example:**

We have a databtase names `test`: 

`test.db`

Running the script `sqlite3-shell.py` will output something like this:

`SQLite3-Shell, brought to you by GeorgeCY2 and c-devhax. Please enter the name of the database you want to connect to.
.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------`

`sqlite-shell> `

To load a database, you can just write the name of your database (without the trailing `.db`).

Once the database has been loaded, you will see `SQLite3 Shell v1.1 by GeorgeCY (Made in Python)` printed to the console, and you will be able to run any sqlite3 commands on said database.

Use `help` during the active session if you want to see the core commands
